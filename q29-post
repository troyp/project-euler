Solution in Python. This is a straightforward approach, calculating the number of duplicates by brute force and subtracting from the number of permutations.
[code=python]
encountered = set()
n_duplicates = 0
for base in xrange(2,101):
    n = base
    for exp in xrange(2,101):
        n *= base
        if n in encountered:
            n_duplicates += 1
        else:
            encountered.add(n)
print 99*99 - n_duplicates
